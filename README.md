ProtectedDownloads
------------------

With this module your SilverStripe 2.4 site can provide individually
authenticated downloads. Downloads can either be authenticated via eMail or
sold via PayPal.

An integrated IPN Receiver keeps track of PayPal PaymentNotifications and a
Log keeps track of all Downloads and Key mailouts.

Each downloadable asset can be protected by an additional license screen.
